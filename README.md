A merge conflict occured while attempting to merge feature/update-styling after merging feature/add-content branch.

Thw conflict occured because both the branches made changes to same part of 'minfy.html'.
To resolve the conflict:
I accepted the pull request,then it redirected to resolve the merge conflict and then manually I edited the conflict and merged the feature/update-styling branch to master.
